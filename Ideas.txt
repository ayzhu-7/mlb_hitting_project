We want to predict the odds of a baseball player getting a home run in a specific game.
Some potential factors include:
- The opposing starting pitcher
- The opposing bullpen
- Recent results (maybe a rolling xBA or a rolling HR percentage or even bat speed)


How do we see how well we would perform against a specific pitcher?
- Success against a specific pitch and then percentages of pitches of that type
- Recent exit velos vs the most common pitches from that pitcher to that handed batter
-
